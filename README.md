# ThemeGrill

Unzip the file and the file location should be:
C:\xampp\htdocs\ThemeGrill

after that you need to activate XAMPP control pannel and activate/start Apache and MySQL

Now, You have to go to the MySQL admin through the XAMPP control pannel 
where, you need to create a database name="themegrill" 

I have added a table students with the file. Now add it to the database you just created.
after that search localhost in you browser and login to it as a teacher.

email = nimadorjelama19@gmail.com
password = 123456789

after logging in you can create, read, view and delete the students.
but when you add a student you need to approve it to display it in student list page
if you reject it stores in database table but doesnot display in view page.
